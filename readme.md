##Bootstrap Laravel

This is a personal implimentation of Laravel 4

This scripts bootstraps laravel with

1. IDE Helper for laravel barryvdh/laravel-ide-helpe
2. PHPs Utility belt anahkiasen/underscore-php
3. Theme Manager teepluss/theme
4. String manipulation library borisguery/inflexible
5. A laravel presenter library robclancy/presenter
6. Code bootstrap library way/generators
7. Basic implimentation of Commander pattern laracasts/commander
8. User Authenciation bootstrap rydurham/sentinel
9  Form helper anahkiasen/former

The scripts need an existing database

A new file credentials.sh must be created with your username and password if you wish to migrate sentinel


Hope this code saves you sometime when building your app
